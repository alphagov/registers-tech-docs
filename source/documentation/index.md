# API documentation for registers

Each register has an open, RESTful API you can use to access the data, which allows you to find out information about the register. You can:

* get all the records from the register
* find records that share attributes with each other
* download the whole or part of the register
* find a single record, entry or item

Registers only provide raw data. You cannot use the APIs to search a register or match data. Depending on your requirements, you may have to build indexes on top of a register to fulfil specific requests.

# API reference 

Each register has an open, RESTful API you can use to access the data. 

Each register API is read-only. 

Registers only provide raw data. You cannot use the APIs to search a register
or match data. Depending on your requirements, you may have to build indexes
on top of a register to fulfil specific requests.

Using different endpoints, you can:

* view [information about a register](/api_reference/#get-register) 
* get all [records from a register](/api_reference/#get-records) 
* get a [specific record within a register based on a particular key](/api_reference/#get-records-key) 
* get all [entries for a single record based on a particular key](/api_reference/#get-records-key-entries) 
* get all [records that share a `field-value` for a particular field](/api_reference/#get-records-field-name-field-value) 
* get all [entries from a register](/api_reference/#get-entries)
* get a [specific entry from a register](/api_reference/#get-entries-entry-number)
* get a [specific item within a register](/api_reference/#get-items-item-hash)
* download the [full contents of a register in a ZIP file](/api_reference/#get-download-register)

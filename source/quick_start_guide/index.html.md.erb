# Quick start guide

### Find the base URL for a register

Find the base URL for a register on its API inspector. For example, the API
inspector for the `local-authority-eng` register is located at
`https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/`.

The following are some examples of base URLs:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Register ID | Base URL |
|----------|----------|
| `local-authority-eng`     | `https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/`|
| `country` | `https://country.register.gov.uk/` |
| `allergen`  | `https://allergen.register.gov.uk/` |

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

### Append the current version of the API
The current version of the API is `v1`.

You should add the version of the API you want to use to the end of the base URL. This step is optional for version 1 of the API and will become required when version 1 is no longer supported.

For example, the full base URL for `v1` of the `local-authority-eng` register is `https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/v1/`.

See [version history](/api_reference/version-history) for the full list of versions.

### Choose an endpoint

You can use endpoints as described in the [API reference](/api_reference/)
section.
### Choose a response format

Choose a response format by adding the appropriate suffix to the request URL:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Format | Suffix | Media type |
|--------|--------|------------|
| JSON | .json | application/json |
| CSV | .csv | text/csv |

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

For example:

```
curl https://country.register.gov.uk/records/GB.json
```

You can also specify a format by making a request with the `Accept` header. For example:

```
curl https://country.register.gov.uk/records/GB --header 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Pagination

API calls on resource collections are paginated. Follow the specific guidance
for each endpoint to get the page(s) of entries and records you need. For
example, to paginate the recordsâ€™ collection use `page-size` to define the
amount of elements you want per page and `page-index` to define the page you
want to get. The maximum `page-size` is 5000.

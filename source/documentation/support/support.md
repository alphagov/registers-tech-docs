### Error codes

| Error code | Description           |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 200        | Ok                    |

### Finding a specific record

If you cannot find a specific record, check you have the correct field value. You must use the exact field value to get a match from the register. For example, in the `local-authority-eng` register, you must capitalise the field value (`BIR`):

Correct request: https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/record/BIR

### HTTPS

GOV.UK Registers follows government [HTTPS security guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-https). This means you must make sure your service (including APIs) is only accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only, with an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

### Technical specification

GDS maintains a [technical specification for registers](https://openregister.github.io/specification/).

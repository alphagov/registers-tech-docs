### If you cannot find a specific record 

Check you have the correct field value. You must use the exact field value to
get a match from the register. 

For example, in the `local-authority-eng` register, you must capitalise the
field value (`BIR`) as in
`https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/records/BIR`

### Technical specification

The Government Digital Service maintains a [technical specification for
registers](https://openregister.github.io/specification/).

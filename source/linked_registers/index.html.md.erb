# Linked registers
<%= partial 'data_format_deprecation_notice.md' %>

Registers can be linked by CURIEs and foreign keys. 

In registers, CURIEs are a datatype, and all new registers will only be linked
by CURIEs. Foreign keys are fields, and not defined by a single datatype.

You can find the datatype of any given field (`{field}`) at
`https://field.register.gov.uk/records/{field}`. 

### CURIEs 

Any value in a field with a datatype of `curie` must be a CURIE. 

For a given register, all CURIEs are of the form `{prefix}:{key}`, where `{prefix}` is mapped to a
base URL of the form `https://{register}.register.gov.uk/records/`. This means that when the `{key}` is blank, it
references the full set of records in that register.

For example, the [datatype of the `organisation` field is `curie`](`https://field.register.gov.uk/records/organisation`). In the [`E09` record of the `statistical-geography` register](https://statistical-geography.register.gov.uk/records/E09.json), the value of the `organisation` field is `government-organisation:D4`. This means that 'E09' in `statistical-geography` links to 'D4' in the `government-organisation` register. 

In the example, 
`{prefix}` is `government-organisation` and `{key}` is
‘D4’. The full expanded URL is therefore
`https://government-organisation.register.gov.uk/records/D4`.

### Foreign keys

Some fields in registers are foreign keys which link to other registers. 

To find this out, you can look at `https://field.register.gov.uk/records/{field}` for a given `{field}`. A field is a foreign key to another register if the `register` field is populated at this address. 

The `local-authority-type` field is a foreign key: `https://field.register.gov.uk/records/local-authority-type`. It’s used in
the `local-authority-eng` register. This means that the `local-authority-type`
field for each record in the `local-authority-eng` register links to a
corresponding record in the `local-authority-type` register. 

For example, the ‘SHE’ record of the `local-authority-eng` register
has the URL `https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/records/SHE`. The
`local-authority-type` field here is populated by `NMD`, so this resolves to
[the ‘NMD’ record in the `local-authority-type` register](https://local-authority-type.register.gov.uk/records/NMD).

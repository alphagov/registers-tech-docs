Registers can be linked by CURIEs and foreign keys. 

In registers, CURIEs are a datatype, and all new registers will only be linked
by CURIEs. Foreign keys are fields, and not defined by a single datatype.

You can find the datatype of any given field (`{field}`) at
`https://field.register.gov.uk/records/{field}`.

# The components of a register
<%= partial 'data_format_deprecation_notice.md' %>

Registers are primarily composed of:

* entries
* items
* records

### Entries

Entries contain metadata about what and when data has changed. 

Entries contain the properties `entry-number`,  `entry-timestamp`, `item-hash`
and `key`. 

The entry number is unique and defines an entry’s position within the ordered
list of changes. The entry timestamp is the time when an entry was introduced
to a given register, but it is no guarantee of the order of entries in a
register. The entry number is.

Each entry is connected to an item by a given item hash. Entries reference
items in the `item-hash` property using the hash derived from the
corresponding item's content.

Each key (in the `key` property) is a unique UTF-8 string which identifies
something in a register. 

Entries also contain the property `index-entry-number`, which is a unique
number that defines an entry's position within the ordered list of an index. 

The `index-entry-number` property depends on indexes, which are an
experimental and unreliable feature.

### Items

Items contain structured data for a given primary key in a register. Items
have predefined fields which are consistent within a register.

The item always contains a field which has the same name as the register. For
example, every item in the `local-authority-eng` register has a field called
`local-authority-eng`. The data contained in this field will be the same as
the data in the key property of the entry that introduced the item to the
register.

### Records

A record corresponds to the latest entry for a particular key, as indicated by
the `entry-number` property.  

### How entries, items and records relate 

The `country` register, and one of its keys, ‘CI’, provides a useful example. 

Using the `GET /entries/{entry-number}` endpoint where `{entry-number}` is
`90` returns the [90th entry to the `country`
register](https://country.register.gov.uk/entries/90.json), which contains
metadata. Using the `GET /items/{item-hash}` endpoint on that entry's item
hash returns [the corresponding
item](https://country.register.gov.uk/items/sha-256:7c16257bd45b4716914010b39dd40e5a6b985b8928d7b8bb0fe3005d2f2b0fec.json),
which reveals that the `official-name` field for the item is ‘The Republic of
Cote D’Ivoire’. 

The more recent [207th entry to the `country`
register](https://country.register.gov.uk/entries/207.json) also relates to
the key ‘CI’. However, this time the item hash addresses to an item that
reveals that the `official-name` field for [the corresponding
item](https://country.register.gov.uk/items/sha-256:b3ca21b3b3a795ab9cd1d10f3d447947328406984f8a461b43d9b74b58cccfe8.json)
is ‘The Republic of Côte D’Ivoire’. The need to change the accent above the
‘o’ required a new entry to the register.

Using the `GET /records/{key}` endpoint returns the most recent entry to the
register for a given `{key}`, with the item data already resolved. For
example, `GET /records/CI` returns the [207th entry and its corresponding
item]( https://country.register.gov.uk/records/CI.json). 

Using the `GET /records/CI/entries` endpoint [returns all entries for the key
'CI'](https://country.register.gov.uk/records/CI/entries.json), meaning both
the 90th and the 207th entries.

### Pagination 

API calls on resource collections are paginated. Follow the specific guidance
for each endpoint to get the page(s) of entries and records you need. For
example, to paginate the recordsâ€™ collection use `page-size` to define the
amount of elements you want per page and `page-index` to define the page you
want to get. The maximum `page-size` is 5000.

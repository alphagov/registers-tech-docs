### How entries, items and records relate 

The `country` register, and one of its keys, ‘CI’, provides a useful example. 

Using the `GET /entries/{entry-number}` endpoint where `{entry-number}` is
`90` returns the [90th entry to the `country`
register](https://country.register.gov.uk/entries/90.json), which contains
metadata. Using the `GET /items/{item-hash}` endpoint on that entry's item
hash returns [the corresponding
item](https://country.register.gov.uk/items/sha-256:7c16257bd45b4716914010b39dd40e5a6b985b8928d7b8bb0fe3005d2f2b0fec.json),
which reveals that the `official-name` field for the item is ‘The Republic of
Cote D’Ivoire’. 

The more recent [207th entry to the `country`
register](https://country.register.gov.uk/entries/207.json) also relates to
the key ‘CI’. However, this time the item hash addresses to an item that
reveals that the `official-name` field for [the corresponding
item](https://country.register.gov.uk/items/sha-256:b3ca21b3b3a795ab9cd1d10f3d447947328406984f8a461b43d9b74b58cccfe8.json)
is ‘The Republic of Côte D’Ivoire’. The need to change the accent above the
‘o’ required a new entry to the register.

Using the `GET /records/{key}` endpoint returns the most recent entry to the
register for a given `{key}`, with the item data already resolved. For
example, `GET /records/CI` returns the [207th entry and its corresponding
item]( https://country.register.gov.uk/records/CI.json). 

Using the `GET /records/CI/entries` endpoint [returns all entries for the key
'CI'](https://country.register.gov.uk/records/CI/entries.json), meaning both
the 90th and the 207th entries.

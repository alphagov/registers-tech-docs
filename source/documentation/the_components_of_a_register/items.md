### Items

Items contain structured data for a given primary key in a register. Items
have predefined fields which are consistent within a register.

The item always contains a field which has the same name as the register. For
example, every item in the `local-authority-eng` register has a field called
`local-authority-eng`. The data contained in this field will be the same as
the data in the key property of the entry that introduced the item to the
register.

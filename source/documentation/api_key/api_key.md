## API keys

If you have created an API key then you can use it with all registers.

Your API key should be of the form `76415efc-3d0f-4522-affd-bb6464e5ea88`. You should it in requests as part of the `Authorization` header. For example, this is a valid request:

```
curl https://country.register.gov.uk/record/GB.json -H "Authorization: 76415efc-3d0f-4522-affd-bb6464e5ea88"
```

## Quick start guide

Each register has an open, RESTful API which you can use to access the data in the register. 

**1. Find the base URL for the register(s) you want to use.** 

You can find the base URL for each register on its API inspector. For example, for the `local-authority-eng` register the API inspector is located at `https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/`. 

The following are some example of base URLs:

| Register ID | Base URL |
|----------|----------|
| `local-authority-eng`     | `https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/`|
| `country` | `https://country.register.gov.uk/` |
| `allergen`  | `https://allergen.register.gov.uk/` |

**2. Find the endpoints you want to use.**

Using different endpoints, you can:

* [view information about a register](#get-register) 
* [get all records from a register](#get-records) 
* [find a specific record within a register](#get-record-field-value) 
* [get all entries for a single record](#get-record-field-value-entries) 
* [find all records that share a `field-value` for a particular field](#get-records-field-name-field-value) 
* [get all entries from a register](#get-entries)
* [find a specific entry from a register](#get-entry-entry-number)
* [find a specific item within a register](#get-item-item-hash)
* [download the full contents of a register in a ZIP file](#get-download-register) 

**3. Choose the format of the response.**

You can choose from the following response formats, and adding the appropriate suffix to the request URL:

| Format | Suffix | Media type |
|--------|--------|------------|
| JSON | .json | application/json |
| YAML | .yaml | text/ yaml |
| CSV | .csv | text/csv |
| TSV | .tsv | text/tsv |
| Turtle | .ttl | text/ttl |

For example, this is a valid request: 

```
curl https://country.register.gov.uk/record/GB.json
```

You can also specify a format by making a request with different headers. For example, this is also a valid request:

```
curl https://country.register.gov.uk/record/GB --header 'accept: application/json'
```

**4. Get register data and use it in your product or service.**

API calls on resource collections are paginated. Follow the specific guidance for each endpoint to get the page(s) of entries and records you need. For example, to paginate the recordsâ€™ collection use `page-size` to define the amount of elements you want per page and `page-index` to define the page you want to get. The maximum `page-size` is 5000.
